                    <h3>Turtle</h3>
                    <p>Box turtles are North American turtles of the genus Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially
                        similar to tortoises in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the
                        American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are
                        distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged
                        at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators.</p>

                    <h3>Sloth</h3>
                    <p>Sloths are arboreal mammals noted for slowness of movement and for spending most of their lives hanging
                        upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America. The six
                        species are in two families: two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths. In spite of this traditional
                        naming, all sloths actually have three toes. The two-toed sloths have two digits, or fingers, on
                        each forelimb.</p>

                    <h3>Red Panda</h3>
                    <p>The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear,
                        is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.[1] It has reddish-brown fur,
                        a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of
                        a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo,
                        but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn,
                        and is largely sedentary during the day.</p>
